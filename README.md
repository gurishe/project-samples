# Sample Project Files  
## Ernie Gurish  
*Each folder holds project files that I have worked on either independently or collaboratively throughough my time at Northeastern. 
The short project descriptions are below as well.*
  
**RESTful Web Server**  
• Collaborated as part of a team to implement a REST API via Java servlets running
on AWS EC2 in both single server and load balanced configurations  
• Deployed and debugged multithreaded client in Java to load test web server and
validate API responses  
• Utilized AWS Console data and Apache Log4j to collect error rate and response time
logs to analyze bottlenecks and potential system improvements  
  
**Database Implementation**  
• Formulated an entity-relationship diagram using a test data set and realized the
diagram into a normalized MySQL schema  
• Cleaned and loaded test data with R into a MySQL schema and queried the data with
SQL to explore trends in the data set  
  
**Raw Socket Programming**  
• Co-authored a Python program that uses raw sockets to download HTTP data from a
command-line provided URL  
• Recreated TCP/IP functionality including checksum validation, packet header parsing,
sequence and acknowledgement number tracking, and TCP congestion window  
  
**Easy Animator**  
• Used Model-View-Controller architecture in Java to realize an application that can output a text-based, SVG, or Java Swing-based animation of basic shapes
